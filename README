The Brainsick code compiler (bscc) is a compiler for a dialect of the
BASIC language.  In particular, bscc aims to be compatible with the
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) language dialect.

bscc is currently at a very early stage.  See the doc/example directory
for example programs which bscc can successfully compile.

bscc is free sofware; see the file COPYING for the full text of the
license.  bscc runs on GNU/Linux hosts, and outputs 32-bit x86 .exe
files.  Usually, .exe files are programs for Microsoft Windows, a
proprietary operating system.  Of note, the .exe files that bscc
produces should fully work under Wine, which is free software.

For compilation and installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.
The file INSTALL also contains instructions on creating a source
distribution tarball.

bscc has runtime dependencies which you should also install.  These are:
  * the commmand line LLVM programs, version 3.0 or later, and
  * the 32-bit (cross) compiler from MinGW-w64, version 4.7.0 or later,
    namely the program i686-w64-mingw32-gcc and its usual libraries.
These are hopefully available from your package manager.

Additionally, bscc has a runtime dependency on libbsa.  We recommend
you compile and install libbsa after installing bscc.  libbsa should
be available whence you obtained bscc.  To be able to run an .exe file
created by bscc, you should then copy or symlink libbsa.dll into the
same directory as the .exe file.  After this, the .exe should run
successfully under Wine.

See the file NEWS for information on user-visible changes to this
program.

Source code documentation can be built by following the instructions
in the file INSTALL.
