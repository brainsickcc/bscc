The Brainsick code compiler (bscc) is a compiler for a dialect of the
BASIC language.

bscc is free sofware; see the file COPYING for the full text of the
license.  bscc runs on GNU/Linux hosts, and outputs 32-bit x86 .exe
files.  Usually, .exe files are programs for Microsoft Windows, a
proprietary operating system.  Of note, the .exe files that bscc
produces should fully work under Wine, which is free software.

For compilation and installation instructions for bscc, see the file
INSTALL.  The file INSTALL also contains instructions for building
source-level documentation, and creating a source distribution tarball.

bscc has two runtime dependencies which you should install.

The first is the 32-bit (cross) compiler from MinGW-w64, version 4.7.0
or later.  Namely this is the program i686-w64-mingw32-gcc and its usual
libraries.  This is hopefully available from your operating system
package manager.

The second runtime dependency of bscc is the library libbsa.  libbsa
should be available whence you obtained bscc.  You must install libbsa
per its own INSTALL instructions, and not just build it.

Finally, in terms of dependencies, you should install Wine from your
operating system package manager.  The executables created by bscc run
under Wine.

Some example programs to be compiled with bscc are bundled with the
bscc source code.  Look in the <doc/example> folder.

See the file NEWS for information on user-visible changes to this
program.
