The Brainsick code compiler (bscc) is an open source compiler for the
classic, pre‐.NET, Visual Basic (VB) language.  Specifically, the VB6
dialect is our main compatibility target.

bscc is free sofware; see the file COPYING for the full text of the
license.  bscc runs on GNU/Linux hosts, and outputs 32-bit x86 .exe
files.  Usually, .exe files are programs for Microsoft Windows, a
proprietary operating system.  Of note, the .exe files that bscc
produces run under Wine, which is free software.

Some example programs to be compiled with bscc are bundled with the
bscc source code.  Look in the <doc/example> folder.

See the file NEWS for information on user-visible changes to this
program.
