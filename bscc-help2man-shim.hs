-- | This program impersonates the program /bscc/ enough for /help2man/
-- to generate a man page for bscc.  Having help2man run a built bscc
-- would introduce a barrier to cross compilation; instead, this program
-- is interpreted on the build machine by runhaskell.  In contrast to
-- the real bscc, this shim program has the advantage of fewer
-- dependencies.

-- | Entry point.  Responds to a command line of \"--help\" or
-- \"version\" the same way bscc would.
