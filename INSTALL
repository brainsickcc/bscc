Compilation and installation guide

These instructions should work on modern Unix-like systems.

From your operating system package manager, install the program
help2man.  Also install the LLVM development package; look for ``llvm''
in bscc.cabal to determine the approach LLVM version.

Install GHC, a Haskell compiler; also install a package manager called
cabal-install.  You may find these bundled together in the ``Haskell
Platform''.  Ensure that the version of cabal-install reported by
  $ cabal --version
meets the requirement of the cabal-version field in bscc.cabal.

Run the following commands in this directory:
  $ cabal sandbox init
  $ cabal update
  $ cabal sandbox add-source bscc-setuphs/
  $ cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-tests
  $ cabal configure --enable-tests
  $ cabal build
  $ cabal test
  $ cabal install --enable-documentation --haddock-executables \
                  --haddock-hyperlink-source

Pay attention to the output of that last command, because it tells you
where it installed the bscc program to.

Next you should install bscc's runtime dependencies.  See the README.

Now you can run the bscc executable you previously installed.  Consult
the examples in the documentation folder.

After you have successfully run ``cabal configure'' above, you can
create a source distribution tarball by running:
  $ cabal sdist
