The subfolders of this directory contain some example BASIC programs
which can be compiled by bscc into executables.

First you must install bscc and its related dependencies.  If doing this
from source, consult bscc's main README and INSTALL instructions.

Open a terminal.

If bscc is in your path, then change directory to the subfolder of any specific
example.  Then simply invoke bscc like this:
  $ bscc -o foo.exe *.bas

Otherwise, and if you installed bscc from source, change directory to
its source code root.  Then run a command like:
  $ cabal run -- -o foo.exe doc/example/hello/*.bas

Finally, run the executable which was outputted by bscc:
  $ wine ./foo.exe
If this fails then you may have forgotten to copy libbsa.dll, as covered
in bscc's main README file.
