What is libbsccts?  libbsccts, pronounced like “lib-biscuits”, is bscc's
target support library.  In particular, it contains code deemed
non-trivial enough not to be directly emitted inline.  This, I think,
makes it at least partially analogous to GCC's libgcc, or LLVM's
compiler-rt.  To clarify, let us consider some things libbsccts is not:
it is not the underlying implementation of the bscc program.  Nor is it
the required runtime library; that is libvbstd.
